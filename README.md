# Discord Bot Template

This project serves as a starting point for a discord bot that is easy to maintain, scalable, and easily understood. 

Built using NodeJs and utilizing discord.js, this template will allow users to quickly get a bot up and running. 

## Set Up

Clone the repository onto your computer : git clone <repo url>

Access the project via command line, and run: `npm install`

Create a discord bot for you to work with and invite it to your server. 
    See : [Discord Developer Docs](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications)

Add a 'secrets.json' file to the root of the project : "/secrets.json". 
    Add your token, bot id, and secret to this json file as such: 


secrets.json
{
    "id": "Your bot id",
    "secret": "Your bot secret here",
    "token": "Your bot token here"
}


## Running the app

Once you have the code cloned, the discord bot created and it's information inside your `/secrets.json` file, navigate to the root of the project via command line and run `node .`

Next go to the server where you invited the bot and type a message. The default bot should respond with "Hey, nice message".
